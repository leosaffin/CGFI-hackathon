# CGFI-hackathon
My Jupyter notebooks for the CGFI hackathon.
I have added them in the state they were in at the end of the hackathon, so probably won't make much sense to anyone reading them.
Most of the actual work is in get_depresys_track_info.ipynb.
Essentially I converted all the track files to netCDF then ran through them calculating TC statistics in different regions drawn out by teammate John Hillier.
This was to produce a bunch of CSV's for others to do some statistics with.
